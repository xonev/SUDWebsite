Managing Churches
=================

The churches section of the directory allows for the listing of churches on the website.
The churches are organized in a rather simple manner.  Churches are members of "conferences" and
the "conferences," in turn, are members of "unions."  These "unions" are the same "unions" that
the directory contacts are organized by.  Because of this, a church could actually be a member
of any department of the Southern Asia Division, although this would probably not be recommended
since it would not make sense in most situations.  The following diagram should help clarify
any unclear points about how the churches are organized.

To access the page to manage the churches, log into the administrator page and click on
Components->Directory->Churches.  You should then get a listing of all of the churches.

Adding/Editing a Church
-----------------------

* To add a new church, click on the "New" button in the upper right-hand corner.  To edit an
  existing church, click on the churches name in the list.

* Once on the editing page, fill out the information.  The required fields are "The Church Name,"
  "Street Address," "Location," "State," and "Conference."  In practice, "Street Address," "Street
  Address 2," and "Location" can all be used to hold whatever information you would like.
  Typically, the Location should be the city or district that the church is in.  If the church is
  in a conference that is already listed, select the conference from the list.  If it is not
  listed, click on the "New Conference" button and type in the name of the new conference.
  You can change the information for the conference later if you choose.

* After filling out the information in the "Details" section, all that is left is to "Save" or "Apply"
  the changes.  If you would like to remain on the same page, click "Apply."  If you would like
  to return to the list of churches, click on "Save."

  to delete by clicking on the checkbox next to it.  After selecting the church(es) to delete,
  click on the delete button.

Managing Church Conferences

to edit a conference then you will need go to the page for editing conferences.  To access it
select Components->Directory->Conferences.

   pair: edit; conference

Adding/Editing a Conference
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* To add a conference, click on the "New" button in the upper right hand corner from the
  page that lists all of the conferences.  To edit a conference, click on the conference's
  name in the list.

* Once on the conference editing page, fill in the conference details.  You can select a "Union"
  from the list to associate the conference with.  Actually, you could associate it with a
  department of the Southern Asia Division as well, but this would not make sense in most cases.

* After filling in the details for the conference, click on either "Save" or "Apply" to submit
  the new conference (or changes to the conference).

* To delete a conference, select it from the list of conferences by checking the checkbox next

  to delete, click on the "Delete" button in the upper right hand corner.
